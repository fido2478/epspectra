In order to check how deadlock happens, we can compile files with "make err1" and "make err2". We provide two kinds of deadlocks happening to depend on the duration of computing procedure such as MARK_DATA and COMPUTE_DATA.
This deadlock is sensitive to the use of "immediate" operater provided in Esterel. We inserted or removed "immediate" operater on modules TIMER, SWITCH, etc.
